## Projects Experience

### Optimizating and developing Deep Learning Inference Framework.
From 03/2017 -- 05/2018 
This project aims to develop a efficiency deep learning inference framework which can run deep learning models in mobile device real time. We develop it from scratch from 03/2017 and many techniques are used. Firstly, from the algorithm aspect the models are designed as small as possible but the accuracy need to be kept. To design these kind of models some ideas are inspired from models such as mobilenet,squeezenet,shufflenet etc.Secondly, the quantize and pruning methods are used.Thirdly, we accelerate the basic operators by using arm neon,dsp and gpu etc. Especially, the qualcomm hexagon dsp are used to accelerate the ops. This framework can run mobilenet in SDM660 more than 30frames/second and many algorithms use this framework such as boken,face detection etc in my worked company.
